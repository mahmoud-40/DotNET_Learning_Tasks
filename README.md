## Task 1: Basic Concepts

Write a C# program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then calculates and displays the sum of these two numbers.

## Task 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Create a class called `Rectangle` with properties for length and width. Include methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle. Write a program that instantiates objects of this class and calculates the area and perimeter for each rectangle.

## Task 3: Class Hierarchy and Inheritance

Define a base class called `Shape` with an abstract method `CalculateArea()`. Implement two derived classes, `Rectangle` and `Circle`, inheriting from `Shape`. Override the `CalculateArea()` method in each derived class to calculate the area of the corresponding shape. Write a program that demonstrates polymorphism by calling the `CalculateArea()` method on objects of both derived classes.

## Task 4: Events Handling

Write a C# program that simulates an event handling scenario using delegates. Define a delegate type called `EventHandler` with a void return type and no parameters. Implement a class called `EventManager` with methods to add and remove event handlers, and a method to trigger the event. Write a program that demonstrates subscribing to and invoking event handlers for a custom event using the `EventManager` class.

## Task 5: Delegates

Define a delegate type called **`MathOperation`** that takes two integer parameters and returns an integer result. Implement methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Write a program that demonstrates the use of delegates by passing different methods to a delegate variable and invoking them.
